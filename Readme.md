Game Rules: Battle of the Decks
Welcome to the revised world of Battle of the Decks! Strategically build your deck, select powerful abilities, and see if you can outlast your opponents in this turn-based, strategy-driven card game.

Objective:
The goal is to build a 5-card deck and strategically choose 3 powers to outsmart and outlast your opponents in a battle, scoring the highest points and being the last one standing.

How to Play:
1. Getting Started: Buy Card Packs
To participate in the game, we reccomned having at least 3 card packs.
Each card pack contains 5 cards, giving you a pool of 15 cards to choose from.
You will use these cards to form your 5-card deck for each match.
2. Build Your Deck: Choose 5 Cards
From the pool of 15 cards you own, choose the best 5 cards to form your battle deck.
Each card has unique attributes:
Power: Determines the card’s strength in attack.
Defense: Determines the card’s ability to withstand attacks.
Ability: Special effects that can change the outcome of the match.
3. Select Your Powers: Pick 3 from 5
Once you have your 5-card deck ready, select 3 powers from the abilities of these 5 cards.
Each power comes with unique effects and benefits:
You might choose an ability that adds defense, deals direct damage, or allows you to control your opponent’s moves.
The remaining 2 cards in the deck will not have their abilities activated but can still contribute with their Power and Defense values.
4. Battle Preparation: Arrange Your Cards
Arrange your 5 cards in the order you want them to appear in the battle.
Strategy is key here! Place cards with high defense at the start to absorb initial attacks or cards with high power at the end to deal finishing blows.
5. Game Mechanics: Battle Phase
The game proceeds in a series of automated rounds where each player's deck faces off against each other.
Each round, one card from your deck will face off against a card from your opponent’s deck.
6. Round Phases:
Ability Activation Phase: If a card's ability was selected as one of your 3 chosen powers, it activates automatically when conditions are met.
Power vs. Defense Phase: The Power values of the attacking card and the Defense values of the defending card are compared:
If the attacker's Power is greater than the defender's Defense, the attacker wins the round.
If the defender's Defense is greater than the attacker's Power, the defender wins.
If both are equal, it's a tie, and both cards remain in play for the next round.
Effects Application Phase: Any activated abilities or triggered effects are resolved. Some abilities may cause direct damage, block future attacks, or remove cards from play.
7. Scoring and Winning:
The player who wins the most rounds within a match scores higher points.
Points System:
Win a match: 3 points
Draw a match: 1 point each
Lose a match: 0 points
The player with the highest points at the end of all matches is declared the winner!
8. End of Match:
After all battles are completed, the player with the highest total points wins!
Use the results to refine your deck for future matches, considering which cards and abilities were most effective.
Tips for Success:
Balance Your Deck: Include cards with both high power and high defense. Defense is just as important as offense.
Choose the Right Powers: Selecting the right 3 powers can make or break your strategy. Think ahead about potential matchups.
Strategize Card Order: Placing cards with high defense upfront can protect your powerful cards until the endgame.
Example Match Scenario:
Player A selects a balanced deck with a mix of high-power and high-defense cards.
Player B opts for a defensive strategy, focusing on abilities that block or mitigate damage.
During the match, Player A's chosen powers allow them to bypass Player B's defenses, winning more rounds and earning higher points.
